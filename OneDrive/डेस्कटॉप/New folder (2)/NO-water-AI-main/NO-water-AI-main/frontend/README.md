# Jal-Drishti Frontend

This is a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript frontend scaffolded to connect to the Flask backend running at `http://localhost:8000`.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` (or the forwarded Codespaces URL) and click "Load Dashboard Data" to fetch API data.

If your backend is at a different URL, set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in an `.env` file in the `frontend` folder, for example:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://redesigned-space-garbanzo-69qj4r7rv4p9crgj9-8000.app.github.dev
```
